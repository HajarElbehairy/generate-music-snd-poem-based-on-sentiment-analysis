# 🎼 Generate Music and Poems Based on Sentiment Analysis

This project performs **sentiment analysis on tweets**, and based on the detected emotional polarity (positive, neutral, or negative), it **generates a relevant poem and a MIDI music file** reflecting that mood.

## 🌟 Features

* 🎯 Real-time sentiment analysis on Twitter data
* 🧠 Poem generation using transformer-based NLP models
* 🎵 Music generation in MIDI format tailored to emotional tones
* 🛠 Configurable pipeline and components for each stage

## 📸 Project Architecture

Here’s a simplified view of the pipeline:

```
Twitter Data ➜ Sentiment Analysis ➜ Mood Classification
              ➜ Poem Generation (NLP) ➜ Music Generation (MIDI)
```



## 🧰 Tech Stack

* **Python** (Core language)
* **Tweepy** for accessing Twitter API
* **Transformers** (HuggingFace) for text generation
* **Music21** and **Mido** for MIDI music generation
* **scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, etc., for processing

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HajarElbehairy/generate-music-snd-poem-based-on-sentiment-analysis.git
   cd generate-music-snd-poem-based-on-sentiment-analysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up your Twitter API credentials** in a `.env` file or directly in the code.

4. **Run the main script**:

   ```bash
   python App.py
   ```

## 🎵 Example Output

After execution, the script will generate:

* ✅ A **poem** saved in `.txt` format
* ✅ A **music file** in `.mid` format
* ✅ Console logs showing the sentiment analysis process
